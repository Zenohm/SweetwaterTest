# Caveats

* This is my first time since college (Feb 8th, 2018) that I have touched PHP
* I have never used Laravel or Eloquent before.
* Because of the above I spent most of the time exploring and manually testing, no time unit testing.
* I have left logic and configuration inside the OrderController. If this were to be unit-tested, I'd pull that out into a service where it can be tested in isolation.
* I have decided to not take time to remove unnecessary code added by the initial project template.
